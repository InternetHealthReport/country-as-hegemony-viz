Some rough notes on how to make a graph in Gephi, just like the one on: https://labs.ripe.net/author/emileaben/how-is-russia-connected-to-the-wider-internet/

step 1) Load the gdf file for a particular country

step 2) Fiddle with graph settings:
appearance , nodes , partitioning
select clabel
select color scheme

node size icon, ranking
choose attribute 'hege'
min size:3 max size: 60


layout:
do 'openord' first (may not be needed)
then do 'forceatlas2'
 before run. modify
    gravity 20 (OR 30)
    prevent overlap


under the graph:
 label text settions
   select 'hegelabel'   smaal font size

   show labels ('T' icon)

   make links 'grey'

then run 'Noverlap'
